Morning exercise has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. It kickstarts your metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories throughout the day. Additionally, it boosts endorphin levels, which can enhance your mood and provide a sense of accomplishment early on.

Regular morning workouts can also improve your sleep patterns. By establishing a routine, your body becomes accustomed to a set schedule, leading to better rest at night. Furthermore, exercising in the morning can help reduce stress and anxiety, setting a positive tone for the rest of the day.
